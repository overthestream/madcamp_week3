Demo Scene - Shows the Elevator with animations.

NOTE 1: elevLEDPanel color can be adjusted using the Emmision Color in the material.
NOTE 2: The UV's were mapped to keep a consistant pixel density across the entire model. The original sizes of textures for materials are:

elevBtn - 256
elevBtnLight - 256

elevDoors - 2048
elevHallFrame - 2048

If lowering the elevMain material to 2048, it is recomended to adjust each of the other materials to half their original size in order to maintain a consistant pixel density:

elevBtn - 128
elevBtnLight - 128
elevDetails - 1024
elevDoors - 1024
elevHallFrame - 1024
